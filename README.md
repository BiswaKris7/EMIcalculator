"# EMIcalculator" 

This app takes in user input of mortgage principal amount, interest rate, and amortization period to calculate the EMI. 
The EMI calculation assumes that the payment frequency is based on a monthly basis.
This is designed to make the EMI calculation much simpler and error-free than is associated with manually doing it. 
It takes in three variables from the users, and the monthly payment will be displayed on the screen.
